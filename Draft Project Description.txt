Our idea is to generate a web app designed similarly to the following dashboard ( show ) ... descripe non technical part if neeed ....
indicator for vwap: compares the vwap 1 hour with the vwap 3 h, we first considered a baseline model to predict if price will increase in the next hour. 
This simply compares the 1 hour vwap with the 3 hour vwap, if it's lower we predict that the price will increase in the next our.
From this we obtained an accuracy of 63% and confusion matrix ( we could add image ).
In our second model we used xgboost to predict the next hour increase or decrease in price given the 1h and 3h vwap,
it gives an accuracy of 74% and confusion matrix of ...
we also considered the production quantity of different energy sources such as... and analyzed their production data from Volue 
during the period 2018 and 2021, we then implemented a customizable percentile calculator for each of them. 
we developed a relevant price changes function on our dashboard with customizable parameters such as threshold and windows-day 
to detect relevant price changes in the time series.
